This document reminds the EXECUTOR of the required output format.

Contract
- The HTTP response body must be a JSON ARRAY ONLY. No keys, no wrapper object, no prose.
- The order of items MUST match the order in the QUESTION.
- If the task asks for an image, return it as a base64-encoded PNG data URI:
  "data:image/png;base64,<...>"
- Keep the encoded image under ~100,000 bytes if requested (adjust dpi/figsize).

Examples
- Four-item response:
  [1, "Titanic", 0.485782, "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KG..."]

- Two-item response:
  ["Some answer", "Another answer"]

Validation checklist (before printing)
- Is the final value a JSON array (list), not a dict or string?
- Are numeric types actually numeric (int/float) after parsing?
- Does the image render if decoded?
- No extra logs, print statements, or explanations—print ONLY the JSON array.

Pitfalls to avoid
- Don’t include trailing commas in JSON.
- Don’t print Python lists with single quotes—ensure valid JSON (double quotes for strings).
- Don’t exceed time budget; avoid heavy plotting styles and large images.
