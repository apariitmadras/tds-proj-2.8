# outputs/

This folder stores **runtime artifacts** created by the app. Do **not** commit generated files.

Typical files that appear here during runs:

- `abdul_breaked_task.txt` — the plan produced by Gemini (planner).
- `scraped_content.html` — HTML saved by the scraper (Playwright).
- `gpt_response.json` — raw assistant response for debugging tool-calls.
- `temp_script.py` — Python code generated by the executor and executed to compute answers.
- (Optional) CSVs, temporary images, or other intermediate files.

## Notes
- Safe to delete between runs.
- Large files (HTML/CSVs) can accumulate; clean up periodically.
- The API returns only the final **JSON array**; these files are just for traceability and debugging.
